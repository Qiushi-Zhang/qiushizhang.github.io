I am a Master’s student in **Mechanical Engineering** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, 
working with **Jeff Ichnowski** at the **Robotics Institute** on problems in 
**robot manipulation**.

My research focuses on **contact-rich manipulation**, with an emphasis on how to 
**engineer learning-based and optimization-based algorithms together with hardware**
to enable precise and robust **force control** during physical interaction. 
I am particularly interested in bridging **control, learning, and mechanical design**
to build robotic systems that can reason about and regulate contact forces in the real world.

My work spans **robotic hardware design**, **embedded motor control**, **physics-based simulation**, 
and **learning and optimization methods** for manipulation tasks involving friction, compliance,
and uncertainty.
